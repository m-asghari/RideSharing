\section{Optimization}
Optimization ideas:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Adaptive grid index or hierarchy index
	\item Clever way of shortest path computation
	\item batch process trip request
\end{itemize}

Other ideas we have discussed:
\begin{itemize}
\item index sampling: use some sampling method to only send new requests to \emph{some} drivers.
\item index filtering: use a spatial index and send new request to drivers in the vicinity of the pickup location.
\item time threshold: wait for a certain amount of time and select the winning bid from bids received within that time. 
\item count threshold: once a certain number of bids are received, select the winning bid from them.
\end{itemize}
