\begin{itemize}
	\item Overall framework: system components
	\item Explain our auction-based mechanism
	\item Describe the algorithm of inserting a trip requests into a set of driver schedules.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lemma}
	\textbf{In the local setting, The profit through our auction-based mechanism is the same as centralized setting.}
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
	\textbf{In the global setting, show the properties of our auction-based mechanism}
\end{lemma}

Show our auction-based mechanism can be adapted for streaming processing.
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item What is a good profile for the rider?
%\item What is a good profile for the driver?
%\item What is a good optimization goal?
%\item How should a driver compute its bid and the updated schedule?
%\item How should the server select a winner?
