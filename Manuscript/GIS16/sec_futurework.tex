%In this paper, we pre-computed the shortest path distances between different nodes of the road network. This is only possible for a static road network. In the future we plan to expand the framework by considering a time-dependent road network. This introduces new challenges as shortest paths have to be calculated on-the-fly. Also, APART processes every request as soon as it is submitted to the server. However, in large markets where the requests are submitted at a high rate, the server can wait for a short time (e.g., 10 seconds) to bundle multiple requests and process them together. It is expected to be able to generate better assignments if multiple requests are processed at the same time. However, this introduces new challenges such as the one-request-to-many-drivers matching in APART will become a many-requests-to-many-drivers matching which will be more complex.
