\section{Introduction}

TO-DO lists:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Problem definition: define driver profile, rider profile and our price model.
	
	\item Define our objective functions (i.e., maximize extra profit), and differentiate it with other optimization goal (e.g., minimize extra distance). 
	%Given a rider and a driver with their profiles, calculate the cost of accepting the rider. 
	
	\item Introduce overall framework, and describe our auction-based mechanism.
	
	\item Properties of our framework in both local setting and global setting. In the local setting, show that we will get the same profit as the centralized setting. In the global setting, show that our technique can achieve certain approximation ratio compared with the global optimal (or upper bound of global optimal),  or vice verse we will suffer from certain degenerated cases.
	
	\item Optimizations: a) Maintain coarse-grained hierarchic index (adaptive grids, quad-tree), b) maintain novel shortest path index which is fine tuned for ride-sharing applications c) batch processing rider requests (single round bidding v.s. multi-round bidding).
