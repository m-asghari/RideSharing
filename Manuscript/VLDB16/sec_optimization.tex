\section{Optimization}

\begin{itemize}
\item sampling: use some sampling method to only send new requests to \emph{some} drivers.
\item filtering: use a spatial index and send new request to drivers in the vicinity of the pickup location.
\item time threshold: wait for a certain amount of time and select the winning bid from bids received within that time. (?)
\item count threshold: once a certain number of bids are received, select the winning bid from them.
\end{itemize}
