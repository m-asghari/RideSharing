\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we presented an on-line truthful and individually rational pricing mechanism for ride-sharing platforms. We presented a latent space transition model in ride-sharing platforms where the drivers can use to predict the number of available drivers at different locations at each point in time. Subsequently, we showed how the drivers can exploit this information to manipulate their bids to increase their own income and cause the platform to lose profit. Next, we introduced a pricing mechanism based on the second-price auction scheme that is both individually rational and truthful. We also showed how the platform can set a reserved price for each request and manage the losses in revenue which happens in the typical second-price auction scheme.

In the future, we plan to expand the framework by dynamically pricing each ride request where the default fare of a request does not only depend on the shortest path for that request, but also depends on other factors such as drivers' availability. The platform can then provide higher incentives to drivers for accepting less popular requests which allows balancing the supply and demand in different regions. Another interesting direction is to predict the final fare of every request and present it to the requester at the time the request is submitted.
